# PhraseExpander (PE) Launcher is a simple utility to make sure PE launches properly upon Windows startup. #

## Description ##
On some computers, for unknown reasons, simply having some programs in your usual startup areas doesn't reliably launch to program. For me, PE is one of them, so I whipped up this little launcher for it.

You can also tweak the delay time before the launcher launcher PE itself, and whether or not PE should start open or minimized to the tray by checking/unchecking the "Autorun" box. Upon launching the launcher, the timer countdown begins immediately (watch the progressbar), and will launch PE when it's done. You can press the Pause button to pause the timer if you want to have time to tweak any of the launcher's settings, and/or use the Launch button to manually launch PE.

## Installation ##
* Just take the PhraseExpander Launcher.exe file and drop it into the same folder on your computer as PhraseExpander.exe.
* Remove any instances of the regular PE in any of the usual Windows startup areas of your computer (registry, startup folders, etc).
* Manually run this launcher once.
* Select a startup area to add this launcher to from the dropdown menu and click the Add button. You can also choose whether or not you want the launcher invisible while it runs.
* From that point on, forget about it as it launches PE for you automatically whenever you start up Windows. If you need/want to change anything with it later, manually run it again.

# Tip: #
For best results, choose the "AutoRun" and "Hidden" options before you click the Add button.
